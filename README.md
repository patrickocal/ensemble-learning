# stable-learning
In this paper I derive a learning map (from samples to prediction functions) on the basis of sentiments (ranking data).  I extend the literature to account for out-of-sample (eg. imagination, leave-one-out, or Dutch books)  validation. I test the model on daily US Treasury bond (Zeros) data.
