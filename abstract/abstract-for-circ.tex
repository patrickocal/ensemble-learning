  A stable learner is a prediction model that generalises to new samples
  without re-evaluation of the current kernel.  In market settings, a learner
  is stable if, and only if, its pricing kernel is arbitrage-free.  Stable
  pricing kernels preserve information and support the efficient markets
  hypothesis since the marginal impact of the next observation is decreasing in
  the relative frequency of its type. Our contribution is to derive the current
  kernel on the basis of sentiments (a mapping from samples to rankings) for a
  broader class of stable learners. This extension of Gilboa and Schmeidler
  (2003) is justified by US Treasury bond market data for the period 1961-2023.
  Our ``partial-3-diversity of data'' condition on daily rankings of annual
  yields holds across 91\% of the sample for all 30 maturity dates. When
  stronger diversity conditions fail, stability requires out-of-sample
  validation: sentient agents may simulate or imagine the impact of novel data;
  artificial ones may engage in leave-one-type-out cross-validation; in market
  settings, one may bypass sentiments and directly rule out Dutch books. Our
  framework embeds current sentiments in a system of potential generalisations
  thus enabling within-sample testing of stability for any form of external
  validation.
