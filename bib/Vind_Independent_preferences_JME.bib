title = {Independent preferences},
abstract = {A simple mathematical result characterizing a subset of a product set is proved and used to obtain additive representations of preferences. The additivity consequences of independence assumptions are obtained for preferences which are not total or transitive. This means that most of the economic theory based on additive preferences - expected utility, discounted 
utility has been generalized to preferences which are not total or transitive. Other economic 
applications of the theorem are given.
