    abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title><p>The ability to cancel redundant information is an important feature of many sensory systems. Cancellation mechanisms in neural systems, however, are not well understood, especially when considering realistic conditions such as signals with different intensities. In this work, we study, employing experimental recordings and computational models, a cerebellar-like circuit in the brain of the weakly electric fish which is able to perform such a cancellation. We observe that <italic>in vivo</italic> recorded neurons in this circuit display a contrast-invariant cancellation of redundant stimuli. We employ a mathematical model to explain this phenomenon, and also to gain insight into several dynamics of the circuit which have not been experimentally measured to date. Interestingly, our model predicts that time-averaged contrast levels of around 15%, which are commonly experienced by interacting fish, would shape the circuit to behave as observed experimentally.</p>},
