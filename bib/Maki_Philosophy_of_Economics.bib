  notes={Page 564 discusses Binmore 1987, 1993 and the Turing machine games. It also discusses ``fast and frugal" strategies as introduced by Gigerenzer, Todd and ABC Research Group (1999), as well as  Rubinstein (1998) on finite state automata in repeated games. The latter in ptc is discusses sensitivity to complexity: so preferences are increasing in payoffs and decreasing in complexity. Interestingly considers lexicographic ranking. Shows set of equilibria is smaller in this setting.}
