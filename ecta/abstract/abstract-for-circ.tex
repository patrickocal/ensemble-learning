  A stable learner is a prediction model that generalizes to new samples
  without re-evaluation of the current kernel.  In market settings, a learner
  is stable if, and only if, its pricing kernel is arbitrage-free.  Stable
  pricing kernels preserve information and support the efficient markets
  hypothesis. We derive the current kernel on the basis of sentiments (a
  mapping from samples to rankings) for a broader class of stable learners.
  This extension of Gilboa and Schmeidler (2003) is justified by US Treasury
  bond market data for 1961-2023.  When the data is insufficiently rich,
  stability requires out-of-sample validation: sentient agents may simulate or
  imagine the impact of novel data; artificial ones may engage in
  leave-one-type-out cross-validation; in market settings, one may bypass
  sentiments and directly rule out Dutch books. Our framework embeds current
  sentiments in a system of potential generalizations to enable within-sample
  testing of stability for any form of external validation.
