  A stable learner is a prediction model that generalises to new samples
  without re-evaluation of the current kernel.  In market settings, a learner
  is stable if, and only if, its pricing kernel is arbitrage-free.  Stable
  pricing kernels preserve information and support the efficient markets
  hypothesis since the marginal impact of the next observation is decreasing in
  the relative frequency of its type. Our contribution is to derive the current
  kernel on the basis of sentiments (a mapping from samples to rankings) for a
  broader class of stable learners. This extension of Gilboa and Schmeidler
  (2003) is justified by US Treasury bond market data for the period 1961-2023.
  Our ``partial-3-diversity of data'' condition on daily rankings of annual
  yields holds across 91\% of the sample for all 30 maturity dates. When
  stronger diversity conditions fail, stability requires out-of-sample
  validation: sentient agents may simulate or imagine the impact of novel data;
  artificial ones may engage in leave-one-type-out cross-validation; in market
  settings, one may bypass sentiments and directly rule out Dutch books. Our
  framework embeds current sentiments in a system of potential generalisations
  thus enabling within-sample testing of stability for any form of external
  validation.

%A learner (prediction model) is stable if it generalizes from the current
%sample of past cases to samples that include novel case types without revising
%the current kernel.  A pricing kernel is stable if neither (i) the arrival of
%a novel case type, nor (ii) the threat of arbitrage cause a re-evaluation of
%the empirical weights it assigns to past cases.  A stable learner that
%forecasts according to the empirical mean also satisfies the statistical
%learning notion of stability: continuity of the learning map from samples to
%learners.  A learner is \emph{stable} if it meaningfully generalizes from the
%current sample of past cases to richer samples (novel case types) without
%revision of the current kernel.  This implies the statistical learning notion
%of stability: a stable learner's prediction error tends to zero as the sample
%size grows. In market settings, stable pricing kernels support the efficient
%markets hypothesis: frequent cases exhibit diminishing proportional returns.
%Our canonical setting is the market for Zeros (zero-coupon bonds derived from
%US Treasuries) where the (pricing) kernel is a function of the annual yield.
%In addition to stability, we require \parthreediv\ (for every three maturity
%dates, past cases generate at least $3$ total rankings): this holds robustly
%on (subsamples of) 1961-2023 daily data whereas other similar conditions
%\citep[for example]{GS_Inductive_inference,GLS-empirical-similarity} do not.
%Stable learners are characterised by the following two equivalent properties:
%given any sample of past cases, (i) the yield accumulation process is
%arbitrage-free (ii) the pricing kernel is the canonical empirical geometric
%mean (with subjective yields). There are therefore three routes to stability:
%sufficiently rich data; out-of-sample validatation; no-Dutch-books validation.
%\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*]
%
%\item acquire a sufficiently rich set of past cases. For example, the
%\fourdiv\ axiom of \citet{GS_Inductive_inference}  (for every four maturity
%dates, past cases generate $4!=24$ rankings of the corresponding annual
%yields).  
%
%\item conditional on any sample of past cases, the pricing kernel is arbitrage
%free.  (This is reminiscent of De Finetti's Dutch book argument for
%conditional probabilities.)
%
%\item assume \parthreediv\ (every three maturity dates generate $3$ rankings)
%and assume some form \end{enumerate} Even with 61 years of daily data,
%\fourdiv\ fails to hold.  The second and third routes to stability require
%some form of external validation or imagination to compensate for the lack of
%rich data.  Our \parthreediv\ (every three maturity dates generate $3$
%rankings) holds after five years.  The third and final

%In particular, \threediv\ (for any three maturity dates, all $3! = 6$ rankings

%years) but fails on the full set (1-30 years).  In contrast, \parthreediv\
%(for any three maturity dates, $4$ rankings arise) holds on 91\% of the data
%for all 30 maturities.  A learner (prediction model) is \emph{stable} if it
%meaningfully generalizes from current samples of past cases to richer ones,
%that contain novel case types, without revision of the current kernel.
