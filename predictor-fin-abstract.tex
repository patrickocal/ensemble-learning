%market for Zeros (zero-coupon bonds derived from US Treasuries).

%A learner (prediction model) is stable if it generalizes from the current
%sample of past cases to samples that include novel case types without revising
%the current kernel. 
%A pricing kernel is stable if neither (i) the arrival of a
%novel case type, nor (ii) the threat of arbitrage cause a re-evaluation of the
%empirical weights it assigns to past cases.  A stable learner that forecasts
%according to the empirical mean also satisfies the statistical learning notion
%of stability: continuity of the learning map from samples to learners.


%A learner is \emph{stable} if it meaningfully generalizes
%from the current sample of past cases to richer samples (novel case types)
%without revision of the current kernel.
%This implies the statistical learning
%notion of stability: a stable learner's prediction error tends to zero as the
%sample size grows. In market settings, stable pricing kernels support the
%efficient markets hypothesis: frequent cases exhibit diminishing proportional
%returns. Our canonical setting is the market for Zeros (zero-coupon bonds
%derived from US Treasuries) where the (pricing) kernel is a function of the
%annual yield.
%In addition to stability, we require \parthreediv\ (for every
%three maturity dates, past cases generate at least $3$ total rankings): this
%holds robustly on (subsamples of) 1961-2023 daily data whereas other similar
%conditions \citep[for example]{GS_Inductive_inference,GLS-empirical-similarity}
%do not.
%  Stable learners are characterised by the following two equivalent
%  properties: given any sample of past cases, (i) the yield accumulation
%  process is arbitrage-free (ii) the pricing kernel is the canonical empirical
%  geometric mean (with subjective yields). There are therefore three routes to
%  stability: sufficiently rich data; out-of-sample validatation; no-Dutch-books
%  validation.

In this paper, I derive a learning map (from samples to a kernel
representation) on the basis of sentiments (rankings).  I extend
\citep{GS_Inductive_inference} to account for a broader class of stable
learner.  A stable learner is a prediction model that generalises to new
samples without re-evaluation of the current kernel.  Stable pricing kernels
preserve information and support the efficient markets hypothesis since the
marginal impact of an additional case (observation) is decreasing in the
relative frequency of its type.  The present extension is justified by daily
US Treasury bond market data for the period 1961-2023: a standard data set
which is insufficiently rich to support a full diversity of rankings of annual
yields for different maturities.  I require that, for any three maturity dates,
the data supports $4$ distinct rankings.  To compensate for this weaker form of
diversity, stable learners prudently engage in out-of-sample validation: for
human agents, simulating or imagining the impact of new data types; for
artificial ones, leave-one-out cross validation. In market settings, the
pricing kernel of a stable learner is arbitrage-free. For such settings, Dutch
book arguments thus provide yet another route to stable learning.

%In
%particular, \threediv\ (for any three maturity dates, all $3! = 6$ rankings
%arise)  holds for 80\% of the 1961-2023 data for shorter maturities (1-7 years)
%but fails on the full set (1-30 years). 
%In contrast, \parthreediv\ (for any
%three maturity dates, $4$ rankings arise) holds on 91\% of the data for all 30
%maturities.  
%   
%   we show that stable pricing kernels support
%    market efficiency because the
